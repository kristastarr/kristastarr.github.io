<h2> About Me </h2>
<div>
<p>
Hello world, my name is Krista. I live in Austin, Texas with my dog and my cat where I eat lots of tacos and drink lots of coffee.  Besides becoming a devloper, one of my other great ambitions in life is to travel as much as possible.   In the words of Alexander Sattler: 
<br>
I would rather own a little and see the world than own the world and see a little. 
</p>
<p>
I have had the incredibly good luck to take not one but two dream vacations in the last two years!  Both trips consisted of a week-long sail abroad a six-cabin catamaran, and were a perfect combination of many of my favorite hobbies (swimming, taking photos, reading, and napping!) all while sailing amongst the beautifully diverse islands in the Carribean and West Indies. 
</p>
<p>
While I can tell you that all of the islands I visited are breathtakingly beautiful, that's pretty much all I can tell you about them!  I decided to use this project as an opportunity to learn a little bit about the history and culture of some of the islands I have visited.  The following information is courtesey of Wikipedia:</p>

If you want to see a really inspiring travel site, I highly recommend checking out <a href="http://www.carleyrudd.com/"> Carley Rudd's website</a>.  I love reading her Journal which showcases her stunning photos as she documents her travels and offers travel tips, among other things. You can also shop for prints or other lifestyle items. I like how the website incorporates a blog, portfolio, and e-commerce shop without creating a lot of visual clutter. I like the minimalist look of the site and how the white background allows her photos to stand out. I think the site is well laid-out and easy to navigate.
