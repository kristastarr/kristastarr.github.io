	<p>My motivation for becoming a developer stems from my experiences working with kids with disabilities. As a case manager for students with visual, cognitive, and physical impairments, I developed an interest in universal design and accessibility. I became fascinated with the way innovations in technology were able improve educational opportunities, medical treatment, and everyday quality of life for people with disabilities. As a full‚Äêstack developer, my goal is to deliver products that offer elegant design and robust functionality, without compromising accessibility. I have a passion for front end work, including design and UX.</p>
	<p>I love being a developer because there are always new things to learn! I am currently working on mastering React and experimenting with a couple of CSS frameworks.</p> 
	<p>I live in Austin with my dog and my cat. When I'm not writing code, I like taking photos, doing yoga, swimming, and traveling.
